# Course-Management
Simplistic view of a university website. Design using the MVC design pattern. Written using bootstrap, css, html jQuery, PHP,  and SQL.

Model-View-Controller(MVC) is a software design pattern where a software is divided into three components the model, the view and the controller. The model part of the software handles the data logic of the software which includes the database and the logic to access the database. The view part of the software handles the layout and display of the software. And the controller implements the business logic and interacts with the view and the model. The view part which is responsible for the display never interacts with the model directly. The MVC design pattern improves maintainablity and security of the software.
